# Tableau-Dashboard
I have created my first Tableau dashboard.
This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of Superstore sales performance across different regions, time periods, and product categories. 
Key performance indicators such as total revenue, profit, and sales are displayed at the top for a quick summary.
Visualizations include a profit distribution map by state, profit trends over time, and bar charts highlighting the most and least profitable product sub-categories and top-performing products. 
Interactive filters allow users to explore the data by region, order date, measure type (sales, profit, quantity), and product category, making the dashboard both informative and user-friendly.
